well-organized experience. Here's what the app offers:

The timer is managed entirely by the admin, who can set, stop, and reset it via the admin panel.
3. Quiz Page with Buzzer Functionality
Includes a buzzer feature for quiz rounds:
When a team presses the buzzer, their screen turns red.
A timestamp of when the buzzer was pressed is displayed on the admin panel.
4. Leaderboard

Admins can update scores in real time via the admin panel.
Deployment Requirements
